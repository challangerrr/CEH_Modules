## Enumeration
  
### What is Enumeration?
Enumeration is the process of extracting¬†user names, machine names, network resources, shares, and services¬†from a system, and its conducted in an intranet environment.

-	Get user names using email IDs :- Most of the time username are hidden in email Ids , or full name or organization name are there in email ID 
-	Get information using default passwords:- Many online resource provide default credential If user doen‚Äôt change their credential . so by from that we can take access.

-    Get user names using SNMP :- Attacker can easily guess snmp string like read-only or read-write string by tool.
-	Brute force AD:-  
- Get user groups from Windows
-	Get information using DNS zone transfers :- If DNS server is not configured properly by administrator than it is a very effective method of gaining information of Organization‚Äôs network.

In this phase, the attacker creates an active connection to the system and performs directed queries to gain more information about the target. The gathered information is used to identify the vulnerabilities or weak points in system security and tries to exploit in the System gaining phase.

Basic login information


#### finger¬†
This tool declare that  who is currently logged in, when and where.
Use:- finger -s 
-	Login     Name       Tty      Idle  Login Time   Office     Office Phone
-	kali      Kali       tty7    10:09  Sep 1 14:14 (:0)

#### w¬† #command
- Show who is logged on and what they are doing.

00:27:15 up  9:32,  1 user,  load average: 0.06, 0.09, 0.09     
USER     TTY      FROM             LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT   
 kali     tty7     :0 14:16   10:11m 30.26s  2.09s xfce4-session



####	ps aux
to see the root service
Linux credential : /store ü°® etc/passwd  | etc/shadow


### SNMP Enumeration
Simple network management protocol
Simple Network Management Protocol¬†(SNMP) is a networking protocol used for the management and monitoring of network-connected devices like routers, switches, in Internet Protocol networks.     
So we enumerate here for user account and devices which are available on the network    
SNMP enumeration is the process of enumerating the users accounts and devices on a SNMP enabled computer.   

Attackers enumerate SNMP to extract information about network resources such as hosts, routers, devices, share Network information such as ARP tables, routing tables, device specific information and traffic statistics.   
‚¶Å	Runs on Port 161 UDP   
‚¶Å	Management Information Base¬†(MIB) - database that stores information

‚¶Å	SNMP service comes with two passwords, which are used to configure and access the SNMP agent from the management station (MIB):   
‚¶Å	Read community string   
‚¶Å	Read/Write community string   
‚¶Å	These strings (passwords) come with a¬†default value, which is same for all the systems.   
‚¶Å	They become easy entry points for attackers if left unchanged by administrator.   


#### Perform snmp enumeration with snmp-check

>Command :- nmap -sU 192.168.1.242
Check port 161 is open or not if it is open lets enumerate 
Command :- snmp-check 192.168.1.242
another tool is onesixtyone -c (wordlist) $ip

Metaploit have auxillary scanner which enumerate the snmp. 
>Use:- auxiliary/scanner/snmp/snmp_enum

SMB Enumeration
command & tool:     
-	nmap -p 139,445 $ip   
-	nbtstat -r $ip     
-	nmblookup -A $ip  
-	smbmap -H ip     
-	nmap --script smb-enum-shares.nse -p 139,445 192.168.1.18            
              >  to check directory login way
-	smbclient -L \\$ip\\

#### Sam file store in window , where all password are stored in encrypted formate.

SAM Database¬†- file where all local passwords are stored (encrypted)   
‚¶Å	Stored in C:\Windows\System32\Config
NetBIOS Enumeration

#### Linux Os have user credential   
/etc/passwd     
/etc/shadow   


#### Network Basic Input Output
‚¶Å	NetBIOS provides name servicing, connectionless communication and some Session layer stuff   
‚¶Å	The browser service in Windows designed to host information about all machines within domain or TCP/IP network segment   
‚¶Å	NetBIOS name is a¬†16-character ASCII string¬†used to identify devices

#### This is window tool for NetBios enumeration.
nbtstat¬†displays protocol statistics and current TCP/IP connections using NetBIOS over TCP/IP.
‚¶Å	nbtstat¬†gives your own info  
‚¶Å	nbtstat -a¬†list the remote machine's name table given its¬†name   
‚¶Å	nbtstat -A¬†- list the remote machine's name table given its¬†IP address   
‚¶Å	nbtstat -n¬†gives local table    
‚¶Å	nbtstat -c¬†gives cache information    
C:\Users\IEUser>nbtstat -A 10.20.20.10
Local Area Connection 2:     

Node IpAddress: [10.20.20.10] Scope Id: []
  NetBIOS Remote Machine Name Table

       Name               Type         Status
    ---------------------------------------------
    IE8WIN7        <00>  UNIQUE      Registered
    WORKGROUP      <00>  GROUP       Registered
    IE8WIN7        <20>  UNIQUE      Registered

    MAC Address = 08-00-27-99-B1-5F


|Code|	Type|  	
|-----:|------:|
|<1B>|	UNIQUE	Domain master browser|
|<1C>|	UNIQUE	Domain controller|
|<1D>|	GROUP	Master browser for subnet|
|<00>|	UNIQUE	Hostname|
|<00>|	GROUP	Domain name|
|<03>|	UNIQUE	Service running on system|
|<20>|	UNIQUE	Server service running|

#### Netbios Enumeraion with nmap
Basically we run nmap script which is nbtstat.nse
>Command:- nmap  --script nbstat.nse 192.168.1.242

We will got the all netBios result
  




#### DNS enumeration 
Domain name system 
DNS enumeration is process in which we get all possible dns record of a target Domain.

In the section of Footprintig we had seen the DNS Footprinting , unaware of dns enumeration we had done much enumeration at that time only like we had seen all possible Dns record from tool , NSLOOKUP
 
Let see another tool for DNS enumeration 

#### DNSrecon:- 
>Command :- dnsrecon -d craw.in
 
#### DNSenum:-
>Command :- dnsenum craw.in  
command :- host $domain
           host -t ns $domain



#### SMTP Enumeration
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
By the word we already get much info about this port system , this port help user to send mail or message.   
‚¶Å	Ports used:   
‚¶Å	SMTP: TCP 25    
‚¶Å	In simple words:¬†users typically use a program that uses SMTP for sending e-mail and either POP3 or IMAP for receiving e-mail.   

#### Enumerating with nmap:
we can enumerate first that it smtp port 25 is open or not    
Command :- nmap -p25 --script smtp-enum-users <target IP> 

PORT   STATE SERVICE
>25/tcp open  smtp
| smtp-commands: WIN-J83C1DR5CV1.ceh.global Hello [10.10.10.10], TURN, SIZE 2097152, ETRN, PIPELINING, DSN, ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES, 8bitmime, BINARYMIME, CHUNKING, VRFY, OK, 
|_ This server supports the following commands: HELO EHLO STARTTLS RCPT DATA RSET MAIL QUIT HELP AUTH TURN ETRN BDAT VRFY 

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.86 seconds

#### Other tools:    
‚¶Å	smtp-user-enum     
‚¶Å	Username guessing tool primarily for use against the default Solaris SMTP service. Can use either EXPN, VRFY or RCPT TO.    
>command:- smtp-user-enum -M VRFY -U /usr/share/wordlists/unix_users.txt -t $ip 

#### This tool enumerate the server gives all the user of servers

### SMTP enum by Metasploit
There are various auxillary scanner , but let focus on the important scanner  
>auxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_version    
auxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_enum


There are more tool are there through which we can enumerate more and Further things 
#### Tool name is : enum4linux 
With the help of this tool we can enumerate and gather info like username, groups, share network
>Command :-  enum4linux [ip]

              Wappalyzer
